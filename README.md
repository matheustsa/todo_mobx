### [MobX](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx)
MobX is a state-management library that makes it simple to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI. This wiring is completely automatic and feels very natural. As the application-developer, you focus purely on what reactive-data needs to be consumed in the UI (and elsewhere) without worrying about keeping the two in sync.

### [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
A wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable, that helps in resource sharing between widgets.
